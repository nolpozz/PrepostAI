realDonaldTrump,"Nov 28, 2025 · 4:10 PM UTC","The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa, because the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch, French, and German settlers. To put it more bluntly, they are killing white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them. Perhaps, worst of all, the soon to be out of business New York Times and the Fake News Media won’t issue a word against this genocide. That’s why all the Liars and Pretenders of the Radical Left Media are going out of business! At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S. Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony. Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year. South Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of Membership anywhere, and we are going to stop all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately.

realDonaldTrump,"Nov 28, 2025 · 4:08 PM UTC","Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the beautiful country of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists take over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela? The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting against Maduro, is Tito Asfura, the Presidential Candidate of the National Party. Tito was the highly successful Mayor of Tegucigalpa where he brought running water to millions, and paved hundreds of kilometers of roads. His chief opponent is Rixi Moncada, who says Fidel Castro is her idol. Normally, the smart people of Honduras, would reject her, and elect Tito Asfura, but the Communists are trying to trick the people by running a third Candidate, Salvador Nasralla. Nasralla is no friend of Freedom. A borderline Communist, he helped Xiomara Castro by running as her Vice President. He won, and helped Castro win. Then he resigned, and is now pretending to be an anti-Communist only for the purposes of splitting Asfura’s vote. The people of Honduras must not be tricked again. The only real friend of Freedom in Honduras is Tito Asfura. Tito and I can work together to fight the Narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to the people of Honduras. I cannot work with Moncada and the Communists, and Nasralla is not a reliable partner for Freedom, and cannot be trusted. I hope the people of Honduras vote for Freedom and Democracy, and elect Tito Asfura, President!",https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1994438342403141889#m,196422,31933
realDonaldTrump,"Nov 28, 2025 · 5:10 AM UTC","A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World, for being “Politically Correct,” and just plain STUPID, when it comes to Immigration. The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels. They and their children are supported through massive payments from Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts, do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in any way, shape, or form. They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real migrant population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.). As an example, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone. The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military, Police, schools, etc. Even as we have progressed technologically, Immigration Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization. These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!",https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1994272683387687053#m,554721,83381

realDonaldTrump,"May 5, 2025 · 2:21 PM UTC","The Democrats are really out of control. They have lost everything, especially their minds! These Radical Left Lunatics are into the “Impeachment thing” again. They have already got two “No Name,” little respected Congressmen, total Whackjobs both, throwing the “Impeachment” of DONALD J. TRUMP around, for about the 20th time, even though they have no idea for what I would be Impeached. Maybe it should be for cleaning up the MESS that they left us on the Border, or the Highest Inflation in our Country’s History or, perhaps, it should be the incompetent Withdrawal from Afghanistan, or Russia, Russia, Russia/Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, or the Attack of Israel on October 7th that only proceeded because they allowed Iran to regain Great Wealth. These Congressmen stated that, they didn’t know why they would Impeach me but, “We just want to do it.” The Republicans should start to think about expelling them from Congress for all of the crimes that they have committed, especially around Election time(s). These are very dishonest people that won’t let our Country heal! Why do we allow them to continuously use Impeachment as a weapon against the President of the United States who, by all accounts, is working hard to SAVE OUR COUNTRY. It’s the same playbook that they used in my First Term, and Republicans are not going to allow them to get away with it again. These are total LOWLIFES, who hate our Country, and everything it stands for. Perhaps we should start playing this game on them, and expel Democrats for the many crimes that they have committed — And these are REAL crimes. Remember, “Shifty” Adam Schiff demanded a Pardon, and they had to use the power of the Auto Pen, and a Full Pardon, for him and the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, to save them from Expulsion, and probably worse!",https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1919396921593958754#m,209711,35432

For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. No longer will we tolerate these Serial Offenders who spread filth, bloodshed, and mayhem on our streets. That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders. We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our Country illegally. The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!",https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1919395973802897676#m,248829,39586

elonmusk,"Dec 2, 2025 · 4:27 AM UTC","Liberals being more depressed than conservatives doesn’t surprise me at all.  When your entire political culture is built around seeing yourself as a victim, it takes a toll.   Victimhood is treated like currency on the left. The more oppressed you claim to be, the more status you get. That kind of mindset wears people down over time. Add to that how often Democrats frame every issue as the end of the world.   Everything is “a crisis,” everything is “under attack,” and everything is “existential.” Living in constant emotional overdrive is exhausting.  And when your worldview is built on feelings instead of consistency or reality, it creates confusion, anxiety, and instability.   Of course it leads to more depression.  If you’re constantly told the world is unfair, hopeless, oppressive, and dangerous, eventually you’ll believe it.

What's the goal, you ask? To turn humanity into a massive superintelligence that can finally figure out the right questions to ask reality itself.  ""Humans are 30~40 trillion cells, trillions of synapses… but the why of it is just so we can increase our understanding of the universe.  I came to the conclusion, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy style, that the answer is 42, but the real problem is we don't even know what the question is.  The hard part is the question, not the answer.  And for that you need a much bigger computer than Earth.  So by expanding the scope and scale of consciousness, we can better understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe.""  He's literally saying the entire purpose of human existence, and everything he's building (Neuralink, Starship, Grok, Optimus), is to turn humanity into a massive superintelligence that can finally figure out the right questions to ask reality itself.  Not to get the answer. To learn how to ask the question that makes the answer meaningful.  This is why he doesn't give a damn about money, politics, or fame anymore.  He's playing the longest game in history:   Turning consciousness into a galaxy-scale instrument so we can finally understand why anything exists at all.

Essentially, what percentage of internet is spent on Twitter? Is there a number to it? On X?  Well, so we have like about 600 million monthly users.  Although it can spike up if there's some major event in the world. It can get up to, I don't know, 800 million or a billion if there's some major event in the world.

elonmusk,"Nov 30, 2025 · 8:15 PM UTC","INSIDE NYT’S HOAX FACTORY   Five months ago, five New York Times reporters were dispatched to create a story about my supposed conflicts of interest working as the White House AI & Crypto Czar.   Through a series of “fact checks” they revealed their accusations, which we debunked in detail. (Not surprisingly the published article included only bits and pieces of our responses.)   Their accusations ranged from a fabricated dinner with a leading tech CEO, to nonexistent promises of access to the President, to baseless claims of influencing defense contracts.   Every time we would prove an accusation false, NYT pivoted to the next allegation. This is why the story has dragged on for five months.   Today they evidently just threw up their hands and published this nothing burger. Anyone who reads the story carefully can see that they strung together a bunch of anecdotes that don’t support the headline. And of course, that was the whole point.   At no point in their constant goalpost-shifting was NYT willing to update the premise of their story to accept that I have no conflicts of interest to uncover.   As it became clear that NYT wasn’t interested in writing a fair story, I hired the law firm Clare Locke, which specializes in defamation law. I’m attaching Clare Locke’s letter to NYT so readers have full context on our interactions with NYT’s reporters over the past several months.   Once you read the letter, it becomes very clear how NYT willfully mischaracterized or ignored the facts to support their bogus narrative.",https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1995225152674533557#m,27016,4707

narrativefoil,"Sep 28, 2025 · 6:17 PM UTC","Today she came. Pale. Trembling. A young woman no older than twenty-five, clutching in her arms her son, her last living fragment of hope. The boy was limp, his little arms hanging as though life itself had slipped from them. His eyes were two dead stars. Behind her walked the grandmother. A grandmother who had already buried too many. Her face so worn that it seemed older than the land itself, older than grief.  The mother spoke haltingly, every word torn from her throat like a piece of flesh. “Diarrhea. Five days,” she whispered, as if naming an unforgivable sin. “But what frightens me…” Her voice cracked. “He no longer eats.”  “Since when?” I asked, though I was afraid to know.  Ah, that silence. That silence was like a bell tolling for the dead. She looked at her mother, as though asking for permission to speak. Then, with a kind of resigned despair, she confessed: “For a long time.”  I gave her medicine. A hollow gesture. A lie we tell ourselves so we do not collapse. She left without a word. But the grandmother stayed.  She came closer. Each step was heavy, as if she were carrying not her own body but the body of every mother who ever lived. She leaned toward me and spoke with the voice of someone who has seen hell. “Do not ask her,” she said. “She cannot say it. The child stopped eating on the day he saw his father fall. He saw the blood. He saw the body. He saw everything.”  Then she too left, and I was alone with the weight of the world.  I am no psychologist. But I have seen the abyss in men’s hearts, and I know what it means when a child refuses life itself. This is not a disease of the stomach. This is the soul crying out: No more.  Tell me, what happens to a child’s mind when the first god he ever knew, his father, is struck down before him? What happens when the one who was meant to shield him from death becomes death?  The father’s blood was not the only thing spilled that day. The child’s faith was spilled with it. The world collapsed for him. There is no food sweet enough to make him want to taste life again.  And this is the deepest cruelty of genocide. It is not the heap of corpses that marks its victory. It is not the smoking ruins. It is not the screams at night. Its triumph is when a living child sits in the dust and refuses the breast, refuses the bread, refuses the world itself.  This child will grow, if he grows, with a hollow inside him no bread will ever fill. No embrace will ever close. He will learn to love with fear, to sleep with ghosts beside him. And one day, when he becomes a father, he will place into his child’s hands not only his love but also his terror.  And this is how extermination stretches its fingers into the future. It kills not only the body but the capacity to live.  Gaza is not merely a place under bombs. It is a factory of grief, a workshop of despair. What is being forged here is not just ruin. It is a generation of children who will one day walk the earth carrying death in their memories, in their dreams, in the way they touch the world.  As I write this, my chest burns. My hands tremble. I feel as though my own heart is being gnawed from the inside by rats. If there is a God, and I dare still to believe, then He must be weeping over Gaza tonight.  Yes, the father was killed. But the greater crime, the eternal crime, is this: the slow, unseen murder of the child’s soul.  This is our apocalypse. Not fire from heaven. Not angels with trumpets. But a child sitting in the rubble, lips pressed shut, eyes empty, refusing to swallow the world’s cruelty.  #GazaGenocide",https://twitter.com/ezzingaza/status/1972365171805839764#m,3040,1693
